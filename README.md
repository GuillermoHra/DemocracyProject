# DemocracyProject
Final project for the web development class at Tecnologico de Monterrey.  
We present a web system that has the objective of connecting citizens and legislators.   
There are two type of users: citizens and legislator.  
The legislators are able to add proposals, while the citizens are able to vote for them.  
Both of them have access to the proposals and the results of the voting.  

Under the branch: **guillermo**, you can find the source code used for the back-end. It was deployed on heroku: https://democracy-project.herokuapp.com/  
Under the branch: **antonio**, you can find the source code used for the front-end. I was deployed on github pages. This a protype that you can use for testing the current version of the system: https://antonaldinho.github.io/democracyproject/html/login.html
